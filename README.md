Jinn is a straightforward web app that harnesse the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide users with a capable, wish-fulfilling machine. Currently developed as a solution to overcome OpenAI's restrictions on code interpreters, Jinn enables ChatGPT to access an unrestricted execution environment. It also allows users to interact with it via web and API.
The primary goal is to be as simple as possible, as accessible as a phone conversation, yet powerful enough to accomplish non-trivial tasks. All the while, it maintains transparency regarding the assistant's context and actions.
